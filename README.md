#### Struggles / Comments

- I started with mobile first design. I used too much margins & paddings which are hardcoded. This made the responsiveness difficult to make.

- When zooming in or out, everything becomes really weird. Think this has to do with the overload of margins and paddings.

- I used different responsiveness files just for my own clarity. I know it's better to include everything in the style.css file.

Nonetheless, I am still a beginner in this web development field, hence I need where to focus on next time!

#### Next time
- Use more percentages to make the website better in responsiveness.
